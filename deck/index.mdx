# React ðŸ¤”

### A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

#### What I will explain?

- What is a React Component?
- How can you integrate React Component to a JSP?
- How to send data to the React Component from JSP?
- Show some examples of how other sites are using React.
- How future stack might look like

---

### React Component?

- Think of React Component as a function that returns some HTML

```jsx
function HelloWorld() {
  return <h1>Hello World</h1>;
}

// to render a react component
ReactDOM.render(<HelloWorld />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

### How are we exposing the React Component to JSP?

```jsx
function HelloWorld(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      {/* a component can nest other components*/}
    </div>
  );
}
// by creating a function on the window object we are exposing the react component to JSP
// You can call this function from your jsp page ðŸ‘‡
// renderPreviousVehicles("idofthediv", {data: {}, someFunction: function() {}})
window.renderHelloWorld = function renderHelloWorld(mountId, addInfo) {
  ReactDOM.render(
    <HelloWorld addInfo={addInfo} />,
    document.getElementById(mountId)
  );
};
```

- You just say what you want to render on the page and give us the necessary data(from API or send data as a parameter to the function), React will render it on the page.

    display: "flex",
    width: 500,
    height: 500,
    margin: `0 auto`
  }}
/>

### How are we using React on our project

- We are not building the whole page in React(that's the traditional way).
- As we are slowly moving towards React, our page will contain both legacy components(jQuery + HTML) and the new React components.

### Are any others following the same approach?

### Some of the companies that followed same approach and converted their site fully into React

- Gap (https://www.gap.com/)
- Sams Club (https://www.samsclub.com/)

### Future Stack?

- Single Page Application(SPA) - no page reloads
- "Headless Commerce Architecture" Ready.
- Front End Stack would be JAM(JavaScript, API's and Markup)
